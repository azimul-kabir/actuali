/// `ensureBudgetReady()`, which awaits the launch task — and that task ends in
/// `syncOnForeground()`. The write then landed milliseconds after a successful
/// sync, so `automaticSync()`'s 1-second rate limit *dropped* the push. The
/// headless process was suspended before anything else synced, leaving the
/// transaction local-only until the next app launch.
///
/// The rate limit exists to coalesce redundant *pull* syncs (several foreground
/// triggers firing at once); it must never swallow a local write.
